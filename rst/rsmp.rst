**Object**
 An object is a abstract term which is used in control and
 supervision systems. An object can have on or more statuses
 that may change depending on changes of circumstance of the
 object or control of the object from external source.
 Communication with the object is made using exchange of
 signals, e.g. commands, status and alarms.

 An object can represent physical equipment or abstract concepts
 E.g. a camera, a control flow alorithm or a group of signs.

 An object is identified using the objects component id. *Please
 note that an object is not necessarily the same thing as an NTS
 object.*

**Aggregated object**
 An aggregated object consists of one or many other objects.
 E.g. Component group (CG)

**Object type**
 An object type is a classification of objects that controls the
 properties of all the objects of the same object type. The
 object type determines how the object is presented in
 supervision system, how it is grouped and which functional
 positions, alarm codes, commands and statuses that exists that
 object type.

**NTS Object**
 Used for objects in NTS

 All control and supervision related functions in NTS consist of
 NTS objects.

 An NTS object can represent on or many objects.

 An NTS objects is identified in the communication interface
 using “externalNtsId”. NTS can not use the format used in
 component-id.

 An object and NTS object and use the same component-id.

**NTS-Object type**
 A NTS object type is a classification of NTS objects.
 Determines among other things which functional positions that
 are possible for the NTS object.

**Component**
 A component is a object or NTS object.

 A component is identified using component-id.

**Component-ID**
 A component-id identifies components.

 The format used for the STA’s sites is specified in the STA

 Road Side Message Protocol

Introduction
============

This document presents a general protocol for communication between
supervision systems and road side equipment, and direct communication
between road side equipments. The aim is to offer a standardized protocol
that works the same way regardless of supplier or type of road side
equipment.

.. _purpose:

Purpose
=======

The purpose of this protocol is to create a standardized way to
communicate between systems at the local level and systems at the
regional level regardless of supplier and technology. The goal is to
be able to easily add and remove signals in new facilities and
applications without having to expand or change the standards and
guidelines. This means that the protocol, as opposed to many other
standards and protocols do not include detailed information about the
signal exchange but is focused on defining the types of signals which
are then described construction or items specifically. The goal is
that in the long term, based on installed systems and objects, is to
be able to produce signal exchange lists of type object that can be
reused in new contracts so that alarm messages, commands, etc. have
the same names regardless of facility or provider.

The purpose of the signal exchange is to provide information relating
to, for example, traffic control managers and administrators. E.g. the
information needed to monitor and control the road side equipment, as
well as the information that can be used for statistics and analysis
of traffic and equipment's status. For instance, alarms contains
sufficient information to be able to create a work order in Maximo
which is then sent to the operating contractor, ie. sufficient
information about the type of skills and equipment necessary to
correct the error. Additional detailed information about an alarm
(e.g. which I/O card has broken, the LED chain that is out of order,
etc.) can read on site via vendor-specific web interface or operator
panel.

Identified requirements
-----------------------

In order to provide an information exchange that is not dependent of
technology area or vendor specific information - four message types
have been identified that cover all types of information that the
Swedish Transport Administration needs. The information in each
message is dynamic and is defined by technical are or specific
equipment using a specific signal exchange list (SXL). The SXL also
represents the interface between the supervision system / other
facilities and equipment. The four message types are:

- **Alarm**. System, traffic- or monitoring alarms that require action
  by the traffic operator or traffic engineer. Usually sent from the
  equipment to the monitoring system when they occur.

- **Aggregated status**. An aggregated status that gives an overview
  glance of the status of the road side equipment. Usually sent from
  the equipment as soon as it changes to the monitoring system.

- **Status**. Status changes, indications and detailed information
  should be logged or made visible at the monitoring system. Sent upon
  request from the supervision system / other facility or using
  subscription (either at status change or at set time interval).

- **Command**. Commands sent from a supervision system or other
  facility to alter the equipment / object status or control
  principle.

Applicability
=============


.. _scope:

Scope
-----

This document is a generic protocol specification for RSMP interface
that describes the protocol transfer mechanisms and function. The
document is a specification that allows for many use cases within and
outside the Swedish Transport Administration. The document is
provided for those who need to implement a RSMP interface.

Responsibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Swedish Transport Administration (STA) is providing this interface
specification as information only. The STA is not responsible for any
consequences that implementation of the specification can lead to for
the supplier or any third party.

.. _object_model:

Object model
------------

This protocol uses the Datex II (datex2.eu) meta-model for its
object model. Meta model consists of a set of rules that describe how
classes and objects are defined. The reason why the Datex II meta-
model has been adopted is that it will eventually provide the
possibility for this protocol to become an international standard that
can later be included with the object model for Datex II.

The object model is technology independent, ie can be implemented in
various ways such as using **ASN.1**, **JSON** or **XML**. However, the
communication between the site and supervision systems / other sites
uses **JSON** format.

.. _transport_of_data:

Transport of data
-----------------

The message flow is different between different types of messages.
Some message types are event driven and are sent without a request (push),
while others are interaction driven, i.e. they sent in response to a
request from a host system or other system (client-server).

To ensure that messages reach their destinations a message acknowledgment
is sent for all messages. This gives the application a simple way to
follow up on the message exchange.

To communicate between sites and supervision systems a pure TCP connection
is used (TCP/IP), and the data sent is based on the JSon format, i.e.
formatted text.

Messages can be sent asynchronously, i.e. while the site or supervision
system is waiting for an answer to a previously sent message it can
can continue to send messages. The exception in the RSMP / SXL version message
(see section rsmpsxl-version_).


Security
^^^^^^^^

Implementing encryption is not required unless otherwise stated. However, if
encryption is used than the following applies:

* Encryption settings needs to be configurable in both the supervision system as
  well as the site.
* For the encrypted communication, SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 or later is used.
* Certificates should be used to verify the identities of equipments.
* Equipment which uses RSMP should contain a user interface for easy management
  of certificates.
* The issuing and renewal of certificates should should be made in cooperation
  with the purchaser unless other arrangement is agreed upon.

.. _comm_establishment_s2i:

Communication establishment between sites and supervision system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When establishing communication between sites and supervision system,
messages are sent in the following order.

Message acknowledgement (see section message-ack_) is implicit in the
following figure.

.. image:: img/establish-site-system.png
   :align: center

1. Site sends RSMP / SXL version (according to section rsmpsxl-version_).

2. The supervision system verifies the RSMP version, SXL version and site id.
   If there is a mismatch the sequence does not proceed. The system responds
   with a MessageNotAck and closes the connection
   (see section message-ack_)

3. The supervision system sends RSMP / SXL version (according to section
   rsmpsxl-version_).

4. The site verifies the RSMP version, SXL version and site id.
   If there is a mismatch the sequence does not proceed. The site responds
   with a MessageNotAck and closes the connection.
   (see section message-ack_)

5. The site sends a Watchdog (according to section watchdog_)

6. The system sends a Watchdog (according to section watchdog_)

7. Aggregated status (according to section aggregatedstatus_).
   If no object for aggregated status is defined in the signal exchange list
   then no aggregated status message is sent.

8. All alarms (incl. active, inactive, suspended, unsuspended and acknowledged)
   are sent. (according to section alarmmessages_).

9. Buffered messages in the equipment's outgoing communication buffer are sent,
   incl. alarms, aggregated status and status updates.

The reason for sending all alarms including inactive ones is because alarms
might otherwise incorrectly remain active in the supervision system if the alarm
is reset and not saved in communication buffer if the equipment is restarted or
replaced.

The reason for sending buffered alarms is for the supervision system to receive
all historical alarm events. The buffered alarms can be distinguished from the
current ones based on their older alarm timestamps. Any buffered alarm events
that contains the exact same alarm event and timestamp as sent when sending all
alarms should not be sent again.

Since only one version of the signal exchange list is allowed to be used
at the communication establishment (according to the version message),
each connected site must either:

* Use the same version of the signal exchange list via the same
  RSMP connection
* Connect to separate supervision systems (e.g. using separate ports)
* Connect to a supervision system that can handle separate signal exchange
  lists depending on the RSMP / SXL version message from the site

.. _comm_establishment_s2s:

Communication establishment between sites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Implementing support for communication between sites is not required unless
otherwise stated. However, if communication between sites is used than the
following applies.

One site acts as a leader and the other one as a follower.

When establishing communication between sites, messages are sent in the
following order.

Message acknowledgement (see section message-ack_) is implicit in the
following figure.

.. image:: img/establish-site-site.png
   :align: center

1. The follower site sends RSMP / SXL version (according to section
   rsmpsxl-version_).

2. The leader site verifies the RSMP version, SXL version and site id.
   If there is a mismatch the sequence does not proceed. The leader site
   responds with a MessageNotAck and closes the connection.
   (see section message-ack_)

3. The leader site sends RSMP / SXL version (according to section
   rsmpsxl-version_).

4. The follower site verifies the RSMP version, SXL version and site id.
   If there is a mismatch the sequence does not proceed. The follower site
   responds with a MessageNotAck and closes the connection.
   (see section message-ack_)

5. The follower site sends Watchdog (according to section watchdog_)

6. The leader site sends Watchdog (according to section watchdog_)

7. Aggregated status (according to section aggregatedstatus_)
   If no object for aggregated status is defined in the signal exchange list
   then no aggregated status message is sent.

For communication between sites the following applies:

* The SXL used is the SXL of the follower site
* The site id (siteId) which is sent in RSMP / SXL version is the
  follower site's site id
* If the site id does not match with the expected site id the connection
  should be terminated. The purpose is to reduce the risk of establishing
  connection with the wrong site
* The component id which is used in all messages is the follower site's
  component id
* Watchdog messages does not adjust the clock
* Alarm messages are not sent
* No communication buffer exist

.. _comm_disruption:

Communication disruption
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the event of an communication disruption the following principles applies:

* If the equipment supports buffering of status messages, the status
  subscriptions remains active regardless of communication disruption and the
  status updates are stored in the equipment's outgoing communication buffer.
* Active subscriptions to status messages which does does not support buffering
  ceases if the communication disruption occurs.
* Once communication is restored all the buffered messages are sent according to
  the communication establishment sequence.
* The communication buffer is stored and sent using the FIFO principle.
* In the event of communications failure or power outage the contens of the
  outgoing communication buffer must not be lost.
* The internal communication buffer of the device must at a minimum be
  sized to be able to store 10000 messages.

The following message types should be buffered in the equipment's outgoing
communication buffer in the event of an communication disruption.

.. _message-types-buffered:

================= ====================================
Message type      Buffered during communication outage
================= ====================================
Alarm messages    Yes
Aggregated status Yes
Status messages   Configurable
Command messages  No
Version messages  No
Watchdog messages No
MessageAck        No
================= ====================================

The following configuration options should exist at the site:

* It should be possible configure which status messages that will be buffered
  during communication outage
* The site should try to reconnect to the supervision system/other site
  during communications failure (yes/no). This configuration option should
  be activated by default unless anything else is agreed upon.
* The reconnect interval should be configurable. The default value should
  be 10 seconds.


Wrapping of packets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both Json and XML packets can be tricky to decode unless one always know that
the packet is complete. Json lacks an end tag and an XML end tag may be
embedded in the text source. In order to reliably detect the end of a packet
one must therefore make an own parser of perform tricks in the code, which is
not very good.

Both Json and XML could contain tab characters (0x09), CR (0x0d) and LF (0x0a).
If the packets are serialized using .NET those special characters does not
exist. Therefore it is a good practice to use formfeed (0x0c), e.g. ’\f’
in C/C++/C#. Formfeed won't be embedded in in the packets so the parser only
needs to search the incoming buffer for 0x0c and deal with every packet.

Example of wrapping of a packet:

.. code::
   :name: json-wrapping

    {
        "mType": "rSMsg",
        "type": "Alarm",
        "mId": "d2e9a9a1-a082-44f5-b4e0-6c9233-a204c",
        "ntsOId": "AB+81102=881WA001",
        "xNId": "23055",
        "cId": "AB+81102=881WA001",
        "aCId": "A001",
        "xACId": "Lamp error #14",
        "xNACId": "3052",
        "aSp": "acknowledge",
        "ack": "Acknowledged",
        "aS": "active",
        "sS", "notSuspended",
        "aTs": "2009-10-02T14:34:34.345Z",
        "cat": "b",
        "pri": "2",
        "rvs": [
         {
             "n": "color",
             "v": "red"
         }]
    }<0x0c>

JSon code 1: An RSMP message with wrapping

The characters between <> is the bytes binary content in hex (ASCII code),
ex <0x0c> is ASCII code 12, e.g. FF (formfeed).

The following principles applies:

* All packets must be ended with a FF (formeed). This includes message
  acknowledgement (see section message-ack_). For example if NotAck is
  used as a consequence for signal exchange list mismatch during communication
  establishment
* Several consecutive FF (formeed) must not be sent, but must be handled
* FF (formeed) in the beginning of the data exchange (after connection
  establishment) must not be sent, but must be handled


Transport between site and supervision system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Supervision system acts a socket server and waits for the site to
connect. If the communication were to fail it is the site’s
responsibility to reconnect.

Transport between sites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One site acts as leader and the other one as a follower.

* The leader site initiates the connection to the following site.
* The follower sites implements a socket server and waits for the leader site
  to connect.
* If the communication were to fail it is the follower site’s responsibility
  to reconnect.


.. _basic_structure:

Basic structure
---------------

Unicode (ISO 10646) and UTF-8 are used for all messages. Please note that
the JSon elements are formatted as JSon string elements and not as JSon
number elements or as JSon boolean elements, with the exception of the
message type "aggregated status" where JSon boolean elements are used.

The reason why JSon string elements are heavily used is to simplify
deserialisation of values where the data type in unknown before casting is
performed, for instance for the values in "return values". Parsing is
recommended to be performed case insensitive.

Empty values are sent as **""** for simple values and as **[]** for arrays.
Optional values can be omitted, but can not be sent as **null** unless
otherwise stated.

In the following example the message type is an alarm message.

.. code-block:: json
   :name: json-basic

   {
       "mType": "rSMsg",
       "type": "Alarm",
       "mId": "E68A0010-C336-41ac-BD58-5C80A72C7092",
       "ntsOId": "F+40100=416CG100",
       "xNId": "23055",
       "cId": "AB+84001=860SG001",
       "aCId": "A001",
       "xACId": "Serious lamp error",
       "xNACId": "3143",
       "aSp": "Issue",
       "ack": "notAcknowledged",
       "aS": "active",
       "sS": "notSuspended",
       "aTs": "2009-10-01T11:59:31.571Z",
       "cat": "D",
       "pri": "2",
       "rvs": [
           {
               "n": "color",
               "v": "red"
           }
       ]
   }

The following table describes the variable content in all message types
which is defined by the signal exchange list (SXL), except version
messages, message acknowledgement messages and watchdog messages.

elements and the titles in the SXL.

cId          componentId    Component id for the object which the message is referring to.
============ ============== ===================

.. _alarmmessages:

Alarm messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An alarm message is sent to the supervision system when:

- An alarm becomes active / inactive
- An alarm is acknowledged
- An alarm is being suspended / un-suspended

An acknowledgment of an alarm does not cause a single alarm event to
be acknowledged but all alarm events for the specific object with the
associated alarm code id. This approach simplifies both in
implementation but also in handling - if many alarms occur on the same
equipment with short time intervals.

A suspend of an alarm causes all alarms from the specific object with
the associated alarm code id to be suspended. This means that alarm messages
stops being sent from the site as long as the suspension is active. As soon
as the suspension is inactivated alarms can be sent again.

Suspending alarms does not affect alarm acknowledgment. This means that
when unsuspending an alarm an alarm can be inactive and not acknowledged.

Alarm messages are event driven and sent to the supervision system
when the alarm occurs. Acknowledgement of alarms and alarm suspend
messages are interaction driven.

Alarm events are referring to 'active' (aSp:Issue), 'suspended' (aSp:Suspend)
and 'acknowledged' (aSp:Acknowledged).

The timestamp (aTs) reflects the individual event according to the
element 'aSp'.

Status Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The status message is a type of message that is sent to the
supervision system or other equipment with the status of one or more
requested objects.

The status message can both be interaction driven or event driver and
can be sent during the following prerequisites:

- When status is requested from the supervision system or other equipment.
- According to subscription – either by using a fixed time interval or
  when the status changes.

Structure for a response message with answer to a request for status subscription for one or several objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A response message with answer to a request for status subscription
has the structure according to the example below. This response is
always sent immediately after request for subscription regardless if
the value recently changed or as an effect of the interval for the
subscription. The reason for sending the response immediately is
because subscriptions usually are established shortly after RSMP
connection establishment and the supervision system needs to update
with the current statuses and events.
If an subscription is already active then the site must not establish
a new subscription but use the existing one. This message type should
not be sent if the subscription already exist.
If the object is not known then the site must not disconnect
but instead answer with this type of message where **q** is set to
**undefined**.

.. _message-ack:

Message acknowledgement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message acknowledgement is sent as an initial answer to all other
messages. This type of message should not be mixed up with alarm
acknowledgement, which has a different function. The purpose of
message acknowledgement is to detect communication disruptions,
function as an acknowledgment that the message has reached its
destination and to verify that the message was understood.

There are two types of message acknowledgement – **Message
acknowledgment** (MessageAck) which confirms that the message was understood and
**Message not acknowledged** (MessageNotAck) which indicates that the message
was not understood.

* Each communicating party should consider the communication to be lost
  (See comm_disruption_) if the following criterias has been met:
  * Message is sent but no message acknowledgement is received within a
    predefined time
  * No other messages are received within a predefined time
* The default timeout value should be 30 seconds.
* If the version messages has not been exchanged according to communication
  establishment sequence
  (See comm_establishment_s2i_ and comm_establishment_s2s_) then
  message acknowledgement (MessageAck/MessageNotAck) should not be sent as a
  response to any other messages other than the version message
  (See rsmpsxl-version_). The lack of acknowledgement forces the other
  communicating party to treat it as communication disruption and disconnect
  and reconnect, ensuring that the connection restarts with communication
  establishment sequence.

The acknowledgement messages are interaction driven and are sent when
any other type message are received.

.. _rsmpsxl-version:

RSMP/SXL Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version of RSMP and revision of SXL are always sent directly after
establishing communication. Both communicating systems send this as
their first message and waits for message response until any other
messages are sent. Information regarding all supported RSMP versions
should be included in the version message. The version message should
be implemented in such a way that is should be possible to add
additional tags/variables (e.g. date) without affecting existing
implementations.

If any discrepancies with the version numbers are detected between the
two communicating systems this should be set using a MessageNotAck.
The communication is terminated after that and an internal alarm is
activated in both communicating system. If both communicating systems
support several RSMP versions it is always the latest version that
should be used.

The principle of the message exchange is defined by the communication
establishment (See comm_establishment_s2i_ and
comm_establishment_s2s_).

.. _watchdog:

Watchdog
^^^^^^^^

The primary purpose of watchdog messages is to ensure that the
communication remains established and to detect any communication
disruptions between site and supervision system. For any subsystem
alarms are used instead.

The secondary purpose of watchdog messages is to provide a timestamp that can
be used for simple time synchronization.

* Time synchronization using the watchdog message should be configurable at the
  site (enabled/disabled)
* If time synchronization is enabled, the site should synchronize its clock
  using the timestamp from watchdog messages – at communication establishment and
  then at least once every 24 hours.
* The interval duration for sending watchdog messages should be
  configurable at both the site and the supervision system. The default
  setting should be (1) once a minute.

Watchdog messages are sent in both directions, both from the site and
from the supervision system. At initial communication establishment
(after version message) the watchdog message should be sent.

Message structure
"""""""""""""""""

A watchdog message has the structure according to the example below.

Guideline - Signal exchange list
================================

Purpose
-------
The purpose with this appendix is to define the format and function of the
signal exchange list. This appendix works as a 'best practice' and does not
define requirements.

Scope
-----
The scope of this appendix is signal exchange list (SXL) which plays a
central role for the function of RSMP. It is recommended to read this
document to get a deeper understanding of for instance implementation
of the RSMP and when designing a new SXL.

Definitions
-----------
All definitions are defined in the RSMP specification.

Responsibility
--------------
The STA provides this interface specification only as information. The
STA does not take responsibility for any consequences which implementation
of the specification can cause manufacturers or third parties.

Signal exchange list
--------------------
The signal exchange list an important functional part of RSMP. The
specification of RSMP is defined in the main document. A template
of the signal exchange list is available on request.

Since the information in every message which is sent with the
communication protocol is dynamic is a predefined signal exchange list
is prerequisite to be able to establish communication. The signal
exchange list defines which message types (signals) which is possible
to send to a specific equipment or object. It is formatted according to
predefined principles which is defined below.

Structure
^^^^^^^^^
The following sections presents the format and contens of the SXL. Each
section corresponds to the names of each sheet in the SXL.

First page
""""""""""
The sheet "First page" defines site(s), revision and date of the SXL.

Object types and object
"""""""""""""""""""""""
The "object types" sheet defines the types of object that can exist in a
site, i.e. "LED".

The object sheet defines the number of each type of object that exists in
the site. If more that one site is defined in the SXL; then one object
sheet needs to be defined for each site.

If more that one site is defined in the same SXL; then the object sheet
is renamed to the name of the site.

The status for an object is suitable to be transmitted to NTS if the
NTS identity (externalNtsId) is defined.

Object definitions
""""""""""""""""""
Depending on applicability, each object type can either have it's own
series or common series of alarm suffix (alarmCodeId), status codes
(statusCodeId) and command codes (commandCodeId).

Single and grouped objects
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
An object can either be categorized as a **single object** or **grouped
object**.

An object is defined under the title **group object** if the object is a
component group according to TDOK 2012:1171. Other objects are defined
under **single object**.

If the **externalNtsId** field is used; it means that the object is adapted
to be sent to NTS.

Other sheets
""""""""""""
The sheets **Alarm**, **Aggregated status**, **Status** and **Command**
corresponds to the respective message type which is defined in the RSMP
specification.

- Italic text which is used as title in columns is not part of the
  protocol, but is only used as a guiding explanation text.
- Return values and argument are optional and there is no limitation on
  how many return values and arguments which can be used for a single
  message.

Overview on functional differencies between different message types

Functional relationships in the signal exchange list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Functional states
"""""""""""""""""
The functional which an object can have should also be possible to control.
Therefore should the command codes which are defined in **"Functional
states** in the **Commands** sheet also correlate the functional states
which are defined in **functionalPosition** in "**Aggregated status**".

Arguments and return values
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Argument and return values makes it possible to send extra information in
messages. It is possible to send binary data (base64), such as bitmap
pictures or other data, both to a site and to supervision system. The
signal exchange list must clarify exactly which data type which is used
in each case. There is no limitation of the number of arguments and
return values which can be defined for a given message. Argument and return
values is defined as extra columns for each row in the signal exchange
list.

- Arguments can be sent with command messages
- Return values can be send with response on status requests or as extra
  information with alarm messages

The following table defines the message types which supports arguments and
return values.

Version mangement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version of RSMP
"""""""""""""""
The version of RSMP defines the overall version of RSMP. All documents
which are part of the RSMP specification refers to version of RSMP. The
following table defines the principles for version numbering for each
document.

.. _table-version-management:

=================================  ========================

RSMP specification                 Version of RSMP
Signal exchange list (SXL)         Own version *and* version of RSMP
=================================  ========================

The document "RSMP specification" uses the version of RSMP, for instance, "1.0".

The signal exchange list (SXL) has it's own version but which version RSMP
that the SXL uses must de defined.

When a new version RSMP is established all associated documents need to be
updated to reflect this.

Revision of SXL
"""""""""""""""
Revision of SXL is unique for a site. In order to uniquely identify a SXL
for a supervision system the identity of the site (siteId) and it's
version of SXL (SXL Revision) needs to be known. In each SXL there must
defined which version of RSMP which it is conforms to.

In order to support a common SXL for many sites where the alarms, status,
and command message types are mostly shared - but there is a risk of
differences can emerge; it is recommended that a table is added on the
front page of each SXL the sites are using. The following table defines
an example for the design of the table.

.. _table-revision:

======  =============================
Site    Revision of SXL which is used
======  =============================
Site 1  1.1
Site 2  1.0
Site 3  1.1
======  =============================
The purpose is to be able to update the SXL with a new revision and at the
samt time inform about which sites which the revision applies to.


Required signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Status messages
"""""""""""""""

Version of component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make sure that the site is equipped with the correct version of
components and to simplify troubleshooting there need to exists a special
status to request version of a component.

Current date and time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make sure that the site is configured with the correct date and time
there needs to be a special status to request this. This type of status is
especially important for those implementations where the equipment's
protocol interface and the rest of it's logic doesn't share the same
clock. Please note that UTC should be used.

Command messages
""""""""""""""""

Change date and time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the automatic time synchronization is missing or disabled there should
be a possibility to set the date and time using a special command. Please
note that UTC should be used.

Best practices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to fit as many technical areas as possible there some flexibility
while designing a signal exchange list. Below are some suggested
recommendations.

Definition of object types
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The level of detail in the definition of object types determines the level
of detail of which:

- Messages can be sent, e.g. alarms and status
- Commands of individual object can be performed
- Information can be presented about the site for maintenance engineers in
  supervision system.

The benefits with a high level of details is:

- Provides the possibility to directly with the component identity be able
  to identify which object the status/alarm is relevant to, which help when
  troubleshooting equipment
- Provides the possibility to block alarm for each object identity

The benefit with a low level of detail is:

- Reduced need to update the signal exchange list due to changes at the
  site
  
The disadvantage with the being able to determine to component identity due
to a lower level of detail can be compensated with arguments and return
values.

Reading and writing data
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Read and write operations uses different message types in RSMP.

Read operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Status messages are used for read operations. Read operations works
as "Process value".

Sequence for a read operation:

1. When data is about to be read a status request is sent from supervision
   system or other site to the relevant site.
2. The site responds by sending the value from the equipment. The value
   is attached as a return value.

Write operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commands messages are used for write operations. Write operations works as
"Set point"/Desired value.

Sequence for a write operation:

1. When data is about be written a command request is sent from
   supervision system or other site the relevant site. The new value
   is attached as an argument.
2. The site is responding with returning the new value from the site,
   using the corresponding command response. The value from the site is
   attached as a return value.
3. The supervision system/other site compares the sent value (desired)
   with the new value from the site (actual value/process value) and can
   determine if the new value could be sent or or not.
